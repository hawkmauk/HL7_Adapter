# Generator is generic and reusable

The code under **`ci/generators/`** is a **generic MDA/SysML generator framework**. It is intended to be **reusable across projects**, not tied to this repository (e.g. HL7 Adapter).

When editing or adding code in `ci/generators/`:

- **Do not** add project-specific implementation details: no HL7, MLLP, adapter, or other domain logic that belongs only to this project.
- **Do not** hardcode names, file paths, or behavior that assume the current project’s structure or content.
- **Do** derive all behavior from the **model** (parsed SysML) and from **generic** configuration (e.g. target type, output paths). The generator should work for any SysML model that follows the same structural conventions.
- **Do** keep project-specific knowledge in the **model** (e.g. `model/`) and in **project config or scripts** (e.g. `scripts/`), not inside the generator.

If a feature requires project-specific logic, implement it in the project layer (model, build scripts, or a thin project-specific driver), not inside `ci/generators/`.
