When creating a CIM we should have the following atrifacts:
example:
```
package CIM {
    package Domain;
    package Stakeholders;
    package Context;
    package Operations;
    package Mission;
    package Assumptions;
}
```
[Domain Ontology]
In SysML v2 you can model a domain ontology directly using:
- conceptual part defs
- item defs / value types
- taxonomies
- relationships
example:
```
package Domain {

    part def <Parcel> 'Parcel';
    part def <DeliveryLocation> 'Delivery Location';
    part def <AirspaceZone> 'Airspace Zone';

    part def <WeatherCondition> 'Weather Condition';

    part def UrbanAirspace : AirspaceZone;
    part def RestrictedAirspace : AirspaceZone;

    association <ParcelDeliveredTo> 'Parcel Delivered To' {
        end parcel : Parcel;
        end location : DeliveryLocation;
    }

}
```

[Concept of Operations (ConOps)]
1. Mission & goals
- Why the system exists.
- problem statement
- objectives
- success criteria
2. Stakeholders & actors
- Who interacts with the system.
- primary users
- external systems
- operators / maintainers
- regulators
3. Operational context
- Where and under what conditions.
- environment
- constraints
- external dependencies
- lifecycle phases
4. Operational scenarios
- Narrative of use in real life.
- normal operation
- degraded modes
- edge cases
- lifecycle scenarios
This is the heart of ConOps.
5. High-level activities
- What happens conceptually (not functions yet).
- user activities
- system responsibilities (black-box)
- interactions
6. Assumptions & constraints
- Non-design constraints.
- policy
- regulatory
- physical context
- organisational rules

Typical diagrams for ConOps:
- stakeholder diagram
- context diagram
- activity diagrams (operational)
- high-level use case diagram
- mission requirements
All still black-box.

Example:
```
package ConOps {

    import Domain::*;
    import Stakeholders::*;
    import Operations::*;

}
package Stakeholders {

    part def <Customer> 'Customer';
    part def <LogisticsOperator> 'Logistics Operator';
    part def <AviationRegulator> 'Aviation Regulator';
    part def <CityAuthority> 'City Authority';

}
package Context {

    part def <DroneDeliveryService> 'Drone Delivery Service';

    part customer : Customer;
    part operator : LogisticsOperator;
    part regulator : AviationRegulator;

    connect customer to DroneDeliveryService;
    connect operator to DroneDeliveryService;
    connect regulator to DroneDeliveryService;

}
package Operations {

    action def <RequestDelivery> 'Request Delivery';
    action def <DispatchDrone> 'Dispatch Drone';
    action def <TransportParcel> 'Transport Parcel';
    action def <ReleaseParcel> 'Release Parcel';
    action def <ConfirmDelivery> 'Confirm Delivery';

    action def NormalDeliveryScenario {
        flow {
            first RequestDelivery;
            then DispatchDrone;
            then TransportParcel;
            then ReleaseParcel;
            then ConfirmDelivery;
        }
    }
}
package Mission {

    requirement <M1> RapidDelivery {
        text = "Parcels are delivered within 30 minutes in the service zone.";
    }

    requirement <M2> PublicSafety {
        text = "Delivery operations do not endanger the public.";
    }

}
package Assumptions {

    constraint def <DesignatedDropZonesExist> 'Designated Drop Zones Exist';
    constraint def <UrbanAirspaceAccessible> 'Urban Airspace Accessible';

}

```
[Stakeholder Needs]

example:
```
package Stakeholders {

    part def <Customer> 'Customer';
    part def <LogisticsOperator> 'Logistics Operator';
    part def <AviationRegulator> 'Aviation Regulator';

}
```

1. Mission Outcomes
What success looks like to stakeholders.
- achieve objective
- deliver capability
- operational effect

2. Operational expectations
How the system behaves in use.
timeliness
usability
availability
safety perception

3. Constraints from stakeholders
Externally imposed limits.
- regulatory
- environmental
- organisational
- policy

4. Quality expectations
Non-functional from stakeholder view.
- safe
- reliable
- quiet
- affordable

5. Lifecycle expectations
Operation & support concerns.
- maintainability
- serviceability
- operability

example:
```
package StakeholderNeeds {

    requirement <SN1> FastDelivery {
        text = "Customers receive parcels quickly after requesting delivery.";
    }

    requirement <SN2> SafeOperations {
        text = "Delivery operations do not endanger the public.";
    }

    requirement <SN3> AirspaceCompliance {
        text = "Delivery flights respect restricted and regulated airspace.";
    }

    requirement <SN4> OperatorEfficiency {
        text = "Operators can supervise multiple concurrent deliveries.";
    }
    
    import Stakeholders::*;

    satisfy FastDelivery by Customer;
    satisfy SafeOperations by AviationRegulator;
    satisfy AirspaceCompliance by AviationRegulator;
    satisfy OperatorEfficiency by LogisticsOperator;
}
```
