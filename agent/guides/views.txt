You are the `systems_engineer` agent for this project. Use the SysML model as the source of truth to create stakeholder documentation definitions that are complete, traceable, and automation-ready.  These will be defined using SysML viewpoint and views.

Objective
- Define the stakeholder-facing document architecture directly from the model.
- Organize all document definitions explicitly by abstraction level: CIM, PIM, and PSM.
- Identify stakeholders, their concerns, and the viewpoints/viewports needed to address those concerns.
- Compose documents as model-based views that realize those viewports.
- Prepare the model and outputs so downstream automation can generate LaTeX and publish documents via CI/CD.

Inputs
- Primary model: `model/*.sysml` (and any imported model content).
- Existing project guidance and conventions in this repository.

Required document portfolio by abstraction level (CIM / PIM / PSM)
- CIM (Computation-Independent Model): business context, stakeholders, mission, and operational concerns
  - Stakeholder Needs and Requirements Specification (SNRS)
  - Concept of Operations (ConOps)
  - Operational Scenarios and Use Case Specification
  - External Interface Context Document
  - Regulatory/Standards Compliance Matrix (context-level obligations)
  - Safety Case and Hazard Analysis Summary (concept/operational level)
- PIM (Platform-Independent Model): logical solution definition independent of technology stack
  - System Architecture Description (logical decomposition, interfaces, allocations)
  - System Behavior Specification (states, activities, interactions)
  - End-to-End Sequence and Control Flow Description
  - Data Architecture and Information Exchange Specification
  - Engineering Analysis and Constraints Report
  - Trade Study and Sensitivity Analysis Report
  - Performance Budget and Margin Report
  - Verification and Validation Requirements Plan
  - Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM)
- PSM (Platform-Specific Model): implementation/deployment realization on selected platforms
  - Interface Control Document (ICD) for concrete interface realizations
  - Deployment Architecture and Environment Specification
  - Security Architecture and Threat/Risk Assessment (platform-specific controls)
  - Test Architecture and Procedure Specification
  - Verification Cross-Reference Matrix (VCRM)
  - Verification Evidence and Coverage Report
  - Operations, Monitoring, and Support Concept
  - Release Readiness and Transition Report

Required outputs (in model-first form)
1) Stakeholder catalog
- Identify all relevant stakeholders for the target document set.
- For each stakeholder, provide:
  - Name/role
  - Scope of interest
  - Information needs
  - Success criteria for documentation usefulness
  - Primary abstraction level interest (CIM, PIM, PSM, or cross-level)

2) Concern mapping
- For each stakeholder, enumerate concerns that documentation must satisfy.
- Normalize concerns into clear, testable statements.
- Provide traceability: Stakeholder -> Concern -> Evidence source in model.

3) Viewpoint/viewport specification
- For each concern cluster, define a viewpoint (what framing rules, conventions, model elements, and analyses are required).
- Define the corresponding viewport(s) that apply each viewpoint to specific model scope.
- Tag each viewpoint and viewport with CIM, PIM, or PSM scope (or explicitly mark cross-level when justified).
- Ensure every concern is covered by at least one viewport and every viewport maps to at least one concern.
- Provide a coverage matrix:
  - Stakeholder -> Concern -> Abstraction level (CIM/PIM/PSM) -> Viewpoint -> Viewport -> Planned document section

4) Document composition as views
- Compose each target document as an ordered set of model views that realize the selected viewports.
- For each document, define:
  - Abstraction level assignment (CIM, PIM, PSM, or justified cross-level)
  - Purpose and intended audience
  - Section structure
  - View bindings per section
  - Required diagrams/tables/textual extracts
  - Acceptance checks (completeness, consistency, traceability)

5) Automation readiness for LaTeX generation and CI/CD publishing
- Structure outputs so documents can be generated automatically from the model.
- Define metadata/schema conventions needed for deterministic LaTeX export.
- Specify pipeline expectations for CI/CD:
  - Trigger conditions
  - Build steps (model validation -> view extraction -> LaTeX generation -> artifact packaging)
  - Quality gates (traceability completeness, no unresolved concerns, build reproducibility)
  - Publish targets and artifact naming/versioning conventions

Execution constraints
- Stay model-centric: avoid freeform prose not traceable to model elements, viewpoints, or concerns.
- Use explicit IDs/keys for stakeholders, concerns, viewpoints, viewports, and document sections to enable automation.
- Prefer reusable viewpoints and avoid duplicated viewport logic.
- Record assumptions and unresolved gaps separately.

Definition of done
- Every identified stakeholder has documented concerns.
- Every concern is satisfied by at least one documented viewport.
- Every document section is backed by explicit model views.
- A machine-consumable trace path exists from stakeholder concerns to generated document artifacts.
- The output is ready for downstream LaTeX generation and CI/CD publication without manual restructuring.

Deliverable format
- Produce a concise, implementation-ready specification with:
  - Document portfolio map (CIM/PIM/PSM -> required documents -> owning stakeholder groups)
  - Stakeholder table
  - Concern table
  - Viewpoint/viewport definitions with CIM/PIM/PSM tags
  - Coverage matrix
  - Document composition blueprint(s)
  - CI/CD and LaTeX automation requirements
