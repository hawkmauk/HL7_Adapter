# Day Three: Diagrams, the GitHub CI Agent, and a Proper Git Workflow

*HL7 Adapter build log — 19 Feb 2026*

Day three started with a concrete goal: **get some diagrams generated automatically** to go alongside the document views. Our ConOps, EICD, gateway signoff, and the rest are already coming out of the model as LaTeX → PDF/HTML, but the views are mostly tables and text. Adding diagrams (even simple ones) would make the docs much easier to scan and would prove that the pipeline can drive more than prose. Getting that into CI meant getting my **GitHub CI agent** to do real work—and I’ve only just started using it.

I’ll be honest: I’ve still been using **ChatGPT outside of Cursor** for a lot of “how do I…?” and “why did this workflow fail?” questions. I’m not sure why; I just prefer asking those questions there rather than using the Cursor feature. Maybe it’s habit, or the sense that CI/YAML is a separate kind of task. Either way, day three was the day I finally leaned on the **GitHub CI/CD Expert** agent (`agent/github_cicd.prompt`) to design and refine the workflows. Its job is to help with GitHub Actions: triggers, jobs, artifacts, caching, and the repo’s conventions (e.g. `python -m ci.generators`, `out/*.tex`, the existing build-docs and release-docs patterns). So I pointed it at “I need to run a diagram step as part of the doc build” and at the current workflow files; it helped get the pipeline to a place where the diagram generation runs in CI and the outputs line up with the rest of the doc artifacts. Still a work in progress, but the agent is now part of the loop.

Once the CI for this is in good shape, I’ve decided to **change how I use git**. So far it’s been mostly direct commits to `main`. That’s fine for a solo spike, but if we want releases, review, and a clearer history, we need **branches and a proper workflow**. So the plan is: feature branches, PRs into `main`, and a release flow that doesn’t rely on “push to main and hope.” To support that, I want to try something more ambitious: **get the Product Owner agent to connect to GitHub and create a roadmap with issues**.

We already have a **Product Owner** agent (`agent/product_owner.prompt`). It’s set up to clarify goals, write user stories and acceptance criteria, and keep the backlog aligned with the MDA lifecycle (CIM → PIM → PSM) and with our document set (SNRS, ConOps, gateway signoff, etc.). What it doesn’t do yet is *talk to GitHub*—create issues, label them, or turn a roadmap into a real backlog in the repo. So the next step is to see whether we can give it that capability: either by having it output structured issue descriptions and labels that I (or a script) can push via the GitHub API, or by wiring it into an action or bot that creates issues from its output. If that works, we’ll have a product owner that doesn’t just draft stories in a vacuum but helps populate the actual board. That’s the experiment.

So day three in short: **diagrams in the pipeline**, **GitHub CI agent in use**, **branch-based workflow planned**, and **Product Owner → GitHub roadmap/issues** as the next thing to try. And yes—I still ask a lot of questions outside Cursor. Maybe that’ll shift as the agents get more of the context; for now it’s just how I’m working.
