# End of a Long Day: Fewer Issues Closed, Stronger Foundations

*HL7 Adapter build log — Feb 2026*

---

It’s near the **end of a long day**. The **number of issues closed hasn’t been very many**, and that’s a **little frustrating**. We were aiming for delivery and we’ve **missed the target**.

What we *have* done is land some **good structural designs** and **code generation patterns**. The component layout, verification cases next to the model, the generator producing both code and tests from the same source—the **project looks healthy**. The foundations are in better shape. It just didn’t translate into as many closed tickets as I’d hoped.

So it’s one of those days where the **metrics (issues closed) don’t tell the full story**. The work that went in was real: structure, patterns, and pipeline improvements that should make tomorrow (and the next project) easier. Still, missing the delivery target stings.

I’ll **carry on tomorrow** and try to **get it over the line before the end of the day**. The goal stays the same; we’re just a day behind. With the structure and patterns in place, the hope is that the remaining work is more execution than discovery.

Long day, not many issues closed—frustrating. But we’ve landed solid structural designs and codegen patterns. Tomorrow: get it over the line.
