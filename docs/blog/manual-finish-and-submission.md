# Manual Finish: Taking the Generated Code to a Working Submission

*HL7 Adapter build log — Feb 2026*

---

I’ve **run out of time**. So I’m **manually finishing the project** now. I’ll take the **generated code** and work on it until there’s a **working version to submit**.

That’s the handover we chose back on day five: get the generator to produce the **majority** of the structure and wiring, then **close the gap by hand**. The model and the generator have done their job—we have components, state machines, verification cases, generated TypeScript, and generated tests. What’s left is to **finish the implementation** in the output: fix the remaining gaps, wire the last pieces, and get a **runnable, submittable build**. No more generator changes for this push; just **take what we’ve got and make it work**.

It’s a pragmatic end to the sprint. The **model-driven story** is there—the design, the docs, and the code all trace back to the SysML. The submission will be **generated code plus manual completion**. Once it’s in, we can reflect on what we’d do differently next time and how far we’d take the generator before handover.

Out of time. Manually finishing the project: taking the generated code and working it until there’s a working version to submit. Model-driven up to the line; then ship by hand.
